        <h3>Oh Hi</h3>

        <p>Hey what's up? If you're here then I suppose you have some interest as to who I am, if not I'm telling you anyways. </p>

        <h3>What About Me?</h3>
        <img src="" alt="Life Stuffness">
        
        <p>My name is Ely Tilley. On July 7, 1995 I was born in a small corner of the united states known as Olympia Washington but lived the first 19 years of my life in a small town of Toledo where I became an eagle Scout. As of right now I am a student at Eastern Washington University and I’m aiming to major in Visual Communications Design and to Minor in 3D Modeling and Animation. I decided to major in VCD the first week of my education at EWU then the next quarter I decided to try a 3D class on a whim, I very quickly came to realize that 3D was what I wanted to do with the rest of my life and that the 3D minor would perfectly compliment the VCD major. </p>
        
        <p>Sometimes the world can seem like a large and frightening place, that there is indeed evil, that monsters do indeed lurk in the dark, I did come to this conclusion this early in life.  Thankfully, I was also taught that the world is a bright and wonderful place full of exceptional experiences, kind people, and that I could do anything I wanted to do. My parents taught me something early on in life, they didn’t particularly intend to teach me this, but I learned it anyways from the path that they helped to set me on in my life and it took me 21 years to realize what I’d known all along, the world is magic. We see it every day, most people simply don’t look for it. The laughter of a baby, the excitement of your dog when you come home, the majesty of a clear night sky, that moment when two soon to be parents see their child in the mother’s ultra sound for the first time…</p>
        
        <blockquote> “There’s magic in the woods, if you know where to look for it.” ~Meacham, Pete’s Dragon</blockquote>
        
        <p>…the world we live in is magic, and don’t you ever let anyone tell you otherwise.</p>
        
        <p>This magic is important, why am I a 21-year-old man so inspired to see magic in the world? when I go camping or hiking, when I go about my day to day life, why do I recognize magic to this degree. Well that’s easy, if you yourself wanted to see magic where is one of the first places you could reliably look? Movies. To this day I try my hardest to watch any animated movie I can because of how powerfully they might inspire me. This is why I’m passionate about art, VCD, 3D animation. I want to inspire others like I was, I want to invoke feelings within people, to make them happy, sad, I want to help people grow by inspiring them with my own brand of magic.</p>
        
        <p>As of right now I don’t know where I see myself in five years, to be honest making freelance animations on the web seems just as likely as being hired by an animation studio. Where ever I go, whatever I do I will pursue my desire to show people just how magic their world actually is.</p>

        <h3>Artistry Pre-College</h3>
        <img src="img/Art_Stuffness.jpg" alt="Art Stuffness">
        
        <p>I started drawing when I was like two-ish I think probably before that to be quite honest. Anyways my mother told me my first drawing was of a truck that was on a sticky note, I think I remember this, but it looked more like a boot if I remember correctly. Anyways I started taking afterschool art classes when I was in Kindergarten at the Morgan Art Center in Toledo. While there, Mike and Diana Morgan encouraged my growth as an artist well into my middle school years. I stopped taking their classes before high school but they became two of the most important people in my life, easily as important as my own family, and I easily owe my artistic skill to them. </p>

        <h3>Scouting Career</h3>
        <img src="img/Eagle_Ceremony.jpg" alt="Eagle Ceremony">
        
        <p>When I was eight years old I joined cub scouts, I was later transferred to troop 9325 where I would spend the rest of my scouting career. I quickly got the Weblos rank and my arrow of light, then became a boy scout with the rest of my troop when I was in sixth grade. We later went to a boy scout camp called Camp Hahobas, I instantly fell in love with this place, we went there a second time next summer and I asked how to get hired, sure enough during my freshman summer I was hired on a volunteer at the camp and would go on to work there for another four years. I would go on many hikes with my friends and fellow scouts, and we’d all be collecting merit badges and one memorable experience after another. As my summer after High School graduation was beginning I would finish my journey to the coveted rank of Eagle Scout, I completed my eagle project June 1st 2013 and go on to receive the rank of Eagle at my eagle ceremony December 1st of that year. </p>

        <h3>Scouting: My Home Away from Home</h3>
        <img src="img/Camp_Staff.jpg" alt="Camp Hahobas">
        
        <p>Camp Hahobas was such an important place to me that I had to talk about it on its own. I worked there for five years, my first year as you know I was a volunteer, the next year I was rehired as payed staff member in the Handicrafts area of camp. I worked in the same area again the next summer and after the completion of my eagle project I would return to Camp Hahobas once again as the new as the new Handicrafts area director, replacing the old director, a magnificent gent by the name of Fish. Finally, after getting my AA at the beginning of the next summer I would return to Camp Hahobas for my final time, once again as the Handicrafts Area director. After that summer I moved to Spokane and got a new job at the Spokane Valley Movie Theater. Camp Hahobas would only open one more time the following summer, a summer that I wish I’d spent at the camp for the camp would close the next summer and to my knowledge have very little chance of reopening. I spent five years of my life teaching other scouts how to do “art things”, five years of my life building memories with a group of people who I came to think of as my second family in a place I’d come to call my home away from home. I’d give just about anything to relive those days of my life.</p>
